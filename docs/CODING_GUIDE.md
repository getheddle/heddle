# Loom Coding, Documentation & Style Guide

This guide defines the coding, commenting, and documentation standards for all
Loom contributors. Code that does not conform will be flagged during review or
by the automated linter.

Read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) first for architectural invariants and
the CLA. This guide covers the **how** of writing code; `CONTRIBUTING.md` covers
the **what** is acceptable.

## Python Version & Language Features

- **Python 3.11+** is required. Use modern syntax freely:
  - `X | Y` union syntax (not `Union[X, Y]`)
  - `dict[str, Any]` lowercase generics (not `Dict[str, Any]`)
  - `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of every module (PEP 563
    deferred evaluation — keeps runtime import cost low and avoids forward-ref
    issues)
- **Pydantic v2** for all data models.
- **asyncio** for all I/O-bound code. Actors are async; blocking calls must be
  offloaded to a thread pool (see `SyncProcessingBackend`).

---

## Code Formatting

All formatting is enforced by **ruff** (configured in `pyproject.toml`).

| Rule | Setting |
|------|---------|
| Line length | 100 characters |
| Indentation | 4 spaces (no tabs) |
| Quotes | Double quotes (`"`) preferred |
| Trailing commas | Required in multi-line constructs |
| Blank lines | 2 between top-level definitions, 1 within classes |

Run the formatter before committing:

```bash
uv run ruff format src/ tests/
uv run ruff check src/ tests/ --fix
```

---

## Naming Conventions

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Modules | `snake_case` | `nats_adapter.py` |
| Classes | `PascalCase` | `PipelineOrchestrator` |
| Functions / methods | `snake_case` | `resolve_tier()` |
| Constants | `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` | `DEAD_LETTER_SUBJECT` |
| Private members | Leading underscore | `_running`, `_refill()` |
| Type variables | `PascalCase` + `T` suffix | `MessageT` |
| Pydantic fields | `snake_case` | `worker_type`, `goal_id` |
| NATS subjects | `dot.separated.lowercase` | `loom.tasks.incoming` |
| CLI commands | `kebab-case` (Click default) | `loom workshop` |
| Config keys (YAML) | `snake_case` | `max_concurrent_goals` |

**Abbreviations:** Avoid unless universally understood (`url`, `id`, `db`).
Spell out domain terms (`orchestrator` not `orch`, `message` not `msg` — except
in `structlog` event names where brevity is expected).

---

## Import Style

Imports are organized into four groups separated by blank lines, sorted
alphabetically within each group:

```python
# 1. __future__ imports (always first)
from __future__ import annotations

# 2. Standard library
import asyncio
import json
from typing import Any

# 3. Third-party
import structlog
import yaml
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

# 4. Local (loom package)
from loom.core.actor import BaseActor
from loom.core.messages import TaskMessage, TaskResult
```

**Rules:**

- Use `from X import Y` for specific names; use `import X` for namespaces you
  reference multiple times (e.g., `import json` then `json.loads()`).
- Never use wildcard imports (`from X import *`).
- Conditional imports (for optional dependencies) go at point of use, not at
  module top:

```python
# Good — only imported when needed, avoids hard dep
async def process(self, ...):
    from loom.worker.knowledge import load_knowledge_silos
    ...
```

- Ruff enforces import sorting automatically via `isort` rules.

---

## Type Annotations

- **Annotate all public function signatures** (parameters and return types).
- Private helper functions: annotations recommended but not strictly required.
- Use `Any` sparingly — prefer specific types. `dict[str, Any]` is acceptable
  for JSON-like data flowing across actor boundaries.
- Use `| None` instead of `Optional[X]`.
- For callback types, use `collections.abc.Callable` (not `typing.Callable`).

```python
# Good
async def call_worker(
    self,
    worker_type: str,
    payload: dict[str, Any],
    tier: str = "standard",
    timeout: float = 60.0,
) -> dict[str, Any]:
    ...

# Bad — missing return type, uses old-style Optional
def call_worker(self, worker_type, payload, tier="standard", timeout=60.0):
    ...
```

---

## Module Docstrings

Every `.py` file **must** have a module-level docstring immediately after the
`"""` opening. This is the single most important piece of documentation — it
tells a reader *what this file does* and *why it exists* without reading any
code.

**Required elements:**

1. **One-line summary** — what the module does.
2. **Context paragraph** — where this fits in the architecture, what depends on
   it, and what it depends on.
3. **Design notes** (if applicable) — why a particular approach was chosen, any
   invariants maintained, known limitations.
4. **See also** (if applicable) — related modules for navigation.

**Template:**

```python
"""
One-line summary of what this module does.

Longer description providing architectural context: how this module fits into
Loom, what calls it, what it calls. Explain the core abstraction or pattern.

Design note: why this approach was chosen over alternatives. For example,
why we use our own JSON Schema validator instead of the jsonschema library.

See also:
    loom.core.messages — the message types this module processes
    loom.bus.nats_adapter — the production bus implementation
"""
```

**Good example** (from `core/actor.py`):

```python
"""
Base actor class — the foundation of Loom's actor model.

All Loom actors (workers, orchestrators, routers) inherit from BaseActor.
This class handles the message bus subscription lifecycle, message dispatch,
signal-based shutdown, and error isolation. Each actor is an independent
process with no shared memory.

Design invariant: actors communicate ONLY through bus messages (see messages.py).
Direct method calls between actors are forbidden.

The message bus is pluggable via the ``bus`` constructor parameter. The default
is NATSBus (created from ``nats_url`` when no bus is provided). For testing,
pass an InMemoryBus instead.
"""
```

---

## Class Docstrings

Every public class must have a docstring explaining:

1. **What it is** (one-line summary).
2. **How to use it** — constructor parameters, key methods, expected lifecycle.
3. **Invariants** — what guarantees it maintains (e.g., "stateless between
   tasks", "thread-safe", "not safe for concurrent use").

Use reStructuredText-style cross-references for related classes:

```python
class PipelineOrchestrator(BaseActor):
    """
    Pipeline orchestrator with automatic stage parallelism.

    Processes an OrchestratorGoal by running it through a series of stages
    organized into execution levels based on their dependencies. Stages
    within the same level run concurrently; levels execute sequentially.
    Stage outputs are accumulated in a context dict and can be referenced
    by subsequent stages via input_mapping.
    """
```

**Private/internal classes:** A brief one-line docstring is sufficient.

---

## Function & Method Docstrings

### When to write a docstring

| Visibility | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| Public API (no underscore) | **Always** — full docstring |
| Protected (`_single_underscore`) | Required if non-trivial (>10 lines or complex logic) |
| Private (`__double_underscore`) | Optional — brief comment often suffices |
| Dunder methods (`__init__`, `__aiter__`) | Required if they accept non-obvious parameters |

### Docstring format

Use **Google-style** docstrings (compatible with Sphinx `napoleon` extension):

```python
async def call_worker(
    self,
    worker_type: str,
    payload: dict[str, Any],
    tier: str = "standard",
    timeout: float = 60.0,
) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Dispatch a task to a worker and wait for the result.

    Publishes a TaskMessage to loom.tasks.incoming and subscribes to
    the result subject. Blocks until a matching TaskResult arrives or
    the timeout expires.

    Args:
        worker_type: Which worker config to dispatch to (e.g., "summarizer").
        payload: Structured input conforming to the worker's input_schema.
        tier: Model tier override. Defaults to "standard".
        timeout: Maximum seconds to wait for a result.

    Returns:
        The worker's output dict (the ``output`` field of TaskResult).

    Raises:
        BridgeTimeoutError: If no result arrives within ``timeout`` seconds.
        BridgeError: If the worker returns a FAILED status.
    """
```

### Rules

- **First line** is a concise imperative summary ("Dispatch a task", not
  "Dispatches a task" or "This method dispatches a task").
- **Blank line** between summary and body.
- **Args section**: list every parameter (except `self`/`cls`). Include types
  only if they add clarity beyond the annotation.
- **Returns section**: describe the return value structure. For dicts, mention
  key fields.
- **Raises section**: list exceptions the caller should handle. Omit generic
  exceptions that indicate bugs (e.g., `TypeError`).
- Keep docstrings **accurate** — an outdated docstring is worse than none. If
  you change a function's behavior, update the docstring in the same commit.

---

## Inline Comments

### When to comment

- **Why, not what.** Don't restate the code. Explain the reasoning behind a
  non-obvious choice.
- **Gotchas and edge cases** — especially Python quirks (e.g., `bool` is a
  subclass of `int`).
- **TODO markers** — use `# TODO: Strategy X — ...` for planned future work.
  Reference the strategy letter from CLAUDE.md so the item is traceable.
- **Performance notes** — if code is written a certain way for performance,
  say so.

### Style

```python
# Good — explains WHY
# Reject bools masquerading as ints (bool is a subclass of int)
if isinstance(value, bool) or not isinstance(value, int):

# Bad — restates the code
# Check if the value is a bool or not an int
if isinstance(value, bool) or not isinstance(value, int):
```

```python
# Good — marks a design decision
# Sequential processing — strict mailbox semantics
await self._process_one(data)

# Good — TODO with strategy reference
# TODO: Strategy A — streaming result collection
```

### Section headers

For long methods or complex logic, use section comment headers:

```python
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Dependency inference and execution level construction
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Keep these consistent: 70-char dashes, no blank line before the first line
after the header.

---

## Error Handling

- **Raise specific exceptions**, not generic `Exception` or `RuntimeError`.
  Define custom exception classes for each module's failure modes:

```python
class PipelineStageError(Exception):
    """Raised when a pipeline stage fails or times out."""

    def __init__(self, stage_name: str, message: str):
        self.stage_name = stage_name
        super().__init__(message)
```

- **Don't silence exceptions** without logging:

```python
# Good
except Exception as e:
    logger.error("actor.error", actor_id=self.actor_id, error=str(e))

# Bad
except Exception:
    pass
```

- **Actor isolation**: individual message failures must not crash the actor
  loop. Catch at the message handler level and log.
- **Validate at boundaries**: check inputs at actor/API boundaries (contract
  validation, message parsing), trust internal code.

---

## Logging

Use **structlog** everywhere. Never use `print()` for operational output.

### Event naming convention

```
{component}.{action}
```

Examples: `actor.connected`, `router.dead_letter`, `worker.tool_round`,
`pipeline.stage_completed`.

### Log levels

| Level | Use for |
|-------|---------|
| `debug` | Internal state details (message contents, intermediate values) |
| `info` | Normal operational events (connected, subscribed, task routed) |
| `warning` | Recoverable issues (unknown tool, condition parse failure, rate limit) |
| `error` | Failures that affect the current operation (task failed, backend error) |

### Structured fields

Always pass context as keyword arguments, not interpolated strings:

```python
# Good
logger.info("router.routing", task_id=task.task_id, tier=tier.value)

# Bad
logger.info(f"Routing task {task.task_id} to tier {tier.value}")
```

---

## Testing

### File naming

- Test file: `test_{module_name}.py` (mirrors `src/loom/{package}/{module}.py`)
- Test class: `Test{ClassName}` (e.g., `TestPipelineOrchestrator`)
- Test function: `test_{behavior_description}` (e.g.,
  `test_stage_timeout_produces_failed_result`)

### Test organization

```python
"""Tests for loom.orchestrator.pipeline — PipelineOrchestrator."""
import pytest

from loom.orchestrator.pipeline import PipelineOrchestrator, PipelineStageError


class TestBuildExecutionLevels:
    """Execution level construction from dependency graphs."""

    def test_independent_stages_in_single_level(self):
        ...

    def test_circular_dependency_raises(self):
        ...


class TestExecuteStage:
    """Single-stage execution with mocked bus."""

    @pytest.fixture
    def pipeline(self):
        ...
```

### Rules

- **No infrastructure required** for unit tests. Use `InMemoryBus` and
  `InMemoryCheckpointStore`.
- Mark integration tests with `@pytest.mark.integration`.
- **Every new feature** must include unit tests. PRs without tests for new code
  will not be merged.
- **Test the contract, not the implementation.** If you test internal methods
  directly, your tests are coupled to implementation details.
- Use `pytest.fixture` for shared setup. Keep fixtures close to where they're
  used (same file or `conftest.py`).
- `asyncio_mode = "auto"` is configured — async test functions work without the
  `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorator.

### Coverage

- Minimum threshold: **70%** (enforced in CI via `fail_under`).
- Target: **85%+** for core modules (`core/`, `worker/`, `orchestrator/`,
  `router/`, `bus/`).
- Use `# pragma: no cover` only for truly unreachable code (e.g.,
  `if __name__ == "__main__"` guards, `TYPE_CHECKING` blocks).

---

## YAML Configuration

Worker and pipeline configs live in `configs/`. Follow these conventions:

- **Top-level keys** in `snake_case`.
- **Include a comment header** explaining what the config does:

```yaml
# summarizer.yaml — Summarize text into structured output.
# Tier: local (Ollama). See _template.yaml for all available keys.
name: summarizer
worker_type: summarizer
```

- **Schema fields** (`input_schema`, `output_schema`) must be valid JSON Schema
  (type: object, with properties and required arrays).
- **Keep configs narrow** — one responsibility per worker. Don't combine
  summarization and classification in a single config.

---

## Git Workflow

- **Branch naming:** `feature/description`, `fix/description`,
  `docs/description`.
- **Commit messages:** imperative mood, concise summary line (<72 chars), with
  optional body explaining why:

```
Add dependency inference to PipelineOrchestrator

Stages now auto-infer dependencies from input_mapping paths instead of
requiring explicit depends_on lists. Uses Kahn's algorithm for
topological sort to detect cycles at config load time.
```

- **One logical change per commit.** Don't mix refactors with features.
- Run `uv run ruff check src/ && uv run pytest tests/ -v -m "not integration"`
  before pushing.

---
