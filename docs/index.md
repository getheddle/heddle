# Heddle

**Turn what you know into testable AI steps. Chain them into workflows.
Measure whether they work. Scale when ready.**

## What Heddle Does

Most AI tools give you one big prompt and one model. That works until it
doesn't — the prompt gets unwieldy, you can't test parts independently,
and asking the same model to review its own work doesn't catch real
problems.

Heddle splits AI work into focused **steps**. Each step has a clear job, a
typed contract (so you know what goes in and what comes out), and can use
a different model. You test steps individually, chain them into pipelines,
and measure whether changes help or hurt.

```text
  Document ──► Extract ──► Classify ──► Summarize ──► Report
                 │            │            │
                 │            │            └─ Claude Opus (complex reasoning)
                 │            └─ LM Studio / Ollama local (fast, free)
                 └─ LM Studio / Ollama local (fast, free)
```

Steps run in parallel when they can, and are tested with the built-in
Workshop web UI — all without deploying any infrastructure. When you're
ready to scale, Heddle adds a message bus (NATS) that connects everything
for production use.

## Try It in 60 Seconds

```bash
pip install heddle-ai[workshop]    # install from PyPI
heddle setup                       # configure (auto-detects LM Studio + Ollama)
heddle workshop                    # open the web UI at localhost:8080
```

Open your browser at `http://localhost:8080`, pick a worker (summarizer,
classifier, extractor, translator, qa, or reviewer), paste any text, and
click Run. No data files needed.

**Have Telegram exports?** Install with `pip install heddle-ai[rag]`
instead, then run `heddle rag ingest`, `heddle rag search`, and
`heddle rag serve` for full social media stream analysis.

## Three Ways to Use Heddle

**1. Workshop (no setup beyond install).** Test shipped workers in the
browser — paste text, get results. Six ready-made workers ship with Heddle.

**2. Build your own steps (guided).** Scaffold workers and pipelines
interactively with `heddle new worker` and `heddle new pipeline` — YAML
is generated for you. Test and evaluate in the Workshop web UI.

**3. Distributed infrastructure (production).** For teams, continuous
processing, or high-throughput scenarios: run the router, workers, and
pipeline orchestrator across machines. Scale any component by running
more copies — NATS load-balances automatically.

## Who This Is For

**Anyone hitting the limits of single-prompt AI.** Whether you're a
student comparing how different models answer questions, a teacher
grading essays and checking for bias, or a city clerk categorizing public
comments — if you need more than one AI step working together, Heddle
gives you a structured way to build that.

**Researchers and analysts** — process documents, extract data, build
analytical pipelines. Heddle's knowledge silos and blind audit pattern
let you get genuine adversarial review of AI-generated analysis — not the
pseudo-review you get when the same model checks its own work.

**AI engineers** — build multi-step LLM workflows with typed contracts,
tool-use, knowledge injection, and pipeline orchestration.

**Platform teams** — deploy to Kubernetes with rate limiting, model tier
management, dead-letter handling, and OpenTelemetry tracing.
