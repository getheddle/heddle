"""P1: ScopeMembershipProjector — root → child membership view.

Per v7 §5.1. Tracks which child aggregates belong to which root.
In-memory in Sprint 2; Sprint 3 migrates to a KeyValueStore-backed
view. Consumed by P2 (:class:`CascadeProjector`) to know which
children to cascade-finalize.

Watches events of every :class:`RootAggregate` type. For each event
whose payload carries the reserved ``_child_membership`` key, the
projector updates its in-memory membership map.

Sprint 4a concrete aggregates emit child-membership signals via this
payload convention from inside ``apply_*()`` handlers.
