"""P2: CascadeProjector — root finalization fan-out to children.

Per v7 §5.1. When a root aggregate's ``InternalFinalized`` event is
observed, look up children via :class:`ScopeMembershipProjector` (P1)
and emit an ``InternalFinalize`` command to each child via the
:class:`CommandHandler`.

Cascade commands carry::

    issued_by = "framework:cascade"
    expected_aggregate_version = None      (opportunistic)
    command_id = deterministic(root_id, child_id, root_event_id)

Determinism on the ``command_id`` is what makes the cascade idempotent
under retry — the same root finalization event always produces the
same set of cascade command IDs, so any retry path that re-runs P2
on the same root event collides on the dedup buffer (Sprint 3 with
snapshot) or the JetStream ``Nats-Msg-Id`` dedup (Sprint 3 wire).
Sprint 2 in-memory: idempotence is guaranteed by the receiving
aggregate's ``apply_internal_finalized`` being a no-op on an
already-finalized aggregate.

Child commands that fail with :class:`CommandRejected` (child
already finalized via a different path) or :class:`ConcurrencyError`
(child concurrently mutated) are swallowed silently — cascade is
opportunistic. P3 (Sprint 3) catches children that never finalize
via the horizon timeout.
