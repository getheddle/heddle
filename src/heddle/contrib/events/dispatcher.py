"""EventDispatcher — fans events out to projectors.

Per v7 §4.9:

- :meth:`EventLog.subscribe` yields an async stream of events for an
  aggregate type.
- The dispatcher iterates the stream; for each event, it invokes
  every registered projector's :meth:`Projector.project` in
  registration order, serially.

Sprint 2 ships serial fan-out as the contract. Sprint 3 may add
parallel-fan-out for projectors that don't share state, but serial
is the documented behaviour — projectors must NOT assume
parallel-safety.

A projector raising an exception is logged but does not stop
subsequent projectors. Projectors are responsible for idempotency
(the dispatcher may re-deliver an event after a crash) and for
propagating ``correlation_id`` on any commands or events they emit.
