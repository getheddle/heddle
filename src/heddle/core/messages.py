"""
Heddle message schemas — the canonical wire format.

All inter-actor communication is typed through these Pydantic models.
Actors ONLY communicate through these message types; raw dicts or
ad-hoc JSON are forbidden. This enforces a contract-driven architecture
where every message is validatable at compile time.

Message flow:
    Client/CLI  ──OrchestratorGoal──>  Orchestrator
    Orchestrator  ──TaskMessage──>  Router  ──TaskMessage──>  Worker
    Worker  ──TaskResult──>  Orchestrator

The event-sourcing wire bodies (``Event``, ``Command``,
and their metadata) live in :mod:`heddle.contrib.events.envelopes` —
distinct from the router-dispatched worker envelopes above because they
target aggregates by natural identity and CAS rather than worker classes.

See Also:
    heddle.core.contracts — JSON Schema validation for payload/output dicts
    heddle.bus.nats_adapter — NATS subject conventions for message routing
    heddle.contrib.events.envelopes — event-sourcing wire envelopes
    heddle.contrib.events.subjects — NATS subject helpers for event-sourcing
    heddle.contrib.events.issuer_conventions — reserved ``issued_by`` prefixes
